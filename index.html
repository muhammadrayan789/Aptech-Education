        <h2>Aptech Pakistan</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>APTECH came to Pakistan in 1998, when the concept of vocational education in I.T. was only up-to learning of
            MS Word and Spreadsheets. APTECH Computer Education gave exposure to Pakistani youth towards global learning
            in I.T. education. Within the short span of time it became the leading I.T. training provider of the country
            with its presence in all the major cities.
            Since last decade, all of our franchise centers are providing Quality Education with international standards
            and an international certificate acceptable and transferable worldwide. During this tenure we have served
            the I.T. Market of Pakistan by producing thousands of quality professionals serving at key positions of
            several MNCs, Software Houses, Banks and other Public and Private sectors across Pakistan and abroad. Being
            the global organization, APTECH is maintaining global standards at every step right from the admission of a
            student to teaching and training, administration to accounts, examination to certification and marketing to
            student placement.</p>
